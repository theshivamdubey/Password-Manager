# Password Manager (Educational)

> **⚠️ Educational project — not a real password manager.** This is a small teaching example of the Java AES API, kept deliberately tiny so it can be read in one sitting. It contains known security flaws, documented below on purpose. **Do not use it to store real passwords** — use an established manager like Bitwarden or KeePassXC.

## What it does

Console app: add site/password pairs, retrieve them. Passwords are AES-encrypted and held in memory while the program runs.

## Known flaws (these are the lesson)

| Flaw | Why it's a problem | Production-grade fix |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Hardcoded key in source code~~ **Fixed** | Anyone with the code can decrypt everything | Key is now derived from a master password via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a random salt — see [`CryptoUtil`](src/PasswordManager/CryptoUtil.java) |
| ~~`Cipher.getInstance("AES")` defaults to ECB mode~~ **Fixed** | ECB leaks patterns — identical plaintexts produce identical ciphertexts | Now uses `AES/GCM/NoPadding` with a random IV per entry — see [`CryptoUtil`](src/PasswordManager/CryptoUtil.java) |
| ~~No salt or IV~~ **Fixed** | Same input always encrypts to the same output | Random salt (key derivation) and random IV (per encryption) are now generated and stored alongside the ciphertext — see [`CryptoUtil`](src/PasswordManager/CryptoUtil.java) |
| ~~In-memory `HashMap` only~~ **Fixed** | Nothing is saved — all entries are lost when the program exits | Entries now persist to a `Properties` vault file with the PBKDF2 salt in its header — see [`PasswordManager`](src/PasswordManager/PasswordManager.java) |
| ~~No master-password verification~~ **Fixed** | Loading a vault with a mistyped password derived a wrong key silently, and the next added entry rewrote the file with rows under two different keys | A verifier blob is stored in the vault header; on unlock it is decrypted and GCM's authentication tag check rejects a wrong password — see [`CryptoUtil.verify`](src/PasswordManager/CryptoUtil.java) |
| ~~Vault file written with default permissions~~ **Fixed** | Any other user on the machine could read the vault. The contents are encrypted, but that is not a reason to leave it world-readable | Vault files are created with owner-only permissions (`0600`) on POSIX filesystems, with a best-effort owner read/write fallback on non-POSIX filesystems such as Windows |
